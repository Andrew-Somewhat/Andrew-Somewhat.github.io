        I don't have a long term goal, i never really had any dreams as a kid either. So what I’m hoping for is to see what kind of cool things can come from code and decide then. 

        When it comes to learning I would say I’m an outlier. Sometimes I simply can’t write anything and others i write too much and have to delete a lot of stuff that isn't relevant to the program. 
        But other than that for this specific course i don’t have a good enough computer for running the programs, I usually use a computer supplied by Taiki e.
        I do have the option to take it home if I fall behind with work.</div>
        
        <div class="hifi">Now as for human skills I would like to improve or develop through E.D.A are Just basic communication skills,
        I’m not the greatest when it comes to talking with others or being open with others.</div>
        
        <div class="midfi">I tend to have a hard time asking for help and try to handle things on my own, how would I overcome this shortcoming? Well there are a lot of helpful people and resources, just kinda on hand. (feels so wrong to refer to people as a resource)
        Time management is hard. Mostly estimating how long something will take.
        If things get too much I’ll just take a break and hope for the best.
        I’ll try to ask for help when the time comes.</div>
        </p></div>
