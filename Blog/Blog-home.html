       <h2>My beliefs</h2>
        <p1>I don’t have any hard outlooks on life or what comes after, but rather i try to focus on the here and now.
        My friends asked me if i believe in any sort of god, and I have to say that I don’t but I don’t outright deny the possibility that one or more gods exist. Seems contradictory right? Which makes it hard to put into words.What I believe in and not believe in are sentaments I can't quite put into words nor do I desire to. So I will just continue to hold them where no one can see or hear them.
