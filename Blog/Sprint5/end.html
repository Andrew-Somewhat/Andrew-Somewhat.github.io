        <div class="lofi"><p>So this is a little embarrassing but i kinda want to make a game. Nothing big of course but just something I can be proud of. 
            Now if we are talking long term goals then that would be to get a job that uses the skills i learn here as well as improve my coding skills,
             just for fun really, i like coding and making things and i don't want that feeling to die out.</p>
        <div class="img3"><img src="../../styles/images/bookhole.jpg" height="500px" width="400px"></div>
            <p>My biggest strength for bootcamp would be my inability to just give up this of course would play into a weakness.
            A double edge sword.</p>
        <div class="img7"><img src="../../styles/images/sure-you.jpg" height="400px" width="500px"></div>    
            <p>Now communication will be very hard for me, especially with people i’m unfamiliar with, so i would really like to improve in that sense.
            
            What are my expectations for myself and the team at boot camp? Honestly for myself I would hope that I can just ask for help when it comes to it rather than trying to solve it myself for hours on end like I did in the foundation’s phase.When comes to the team I see them as an all knowing code machine.
