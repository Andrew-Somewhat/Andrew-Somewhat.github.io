            The roles of values, empathy and self awareness in terms of learning and programing are mostly to keep you grounded i would say.</p><p>something that surprised me about core learning is the usefulness of it all really.I went in thinking i wouldn't need it much but as I've gotten more and more into it ive come out with a lot more of an appreciation for mindfulness and all that other good stuff.
            Why I think core learning is important to learn in a course  about coding is, well coding is a lot of trial and error and that plagues a fair bit on your mind.</p><p>
            Do I think that the time spent learning core skills was a waste of time? No. Now that I've gotten into the bootcamp side of things Iâ€™ll say that I don't get a whole lot of spare time so being able to manage the stress of it all is real cool.
