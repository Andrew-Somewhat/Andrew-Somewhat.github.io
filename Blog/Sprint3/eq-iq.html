        <div class="para9"><div class="lofi"><p>E.Q stands for emotional intelligence. So it is the capacity to measure how well you understand and express your emotions, as well as control them. What does that mean though? Well there are 5 main points to E.Q and they are self awareness, self regulation, motivation, social awareness and social regulation.
            As the names imply self awareness and social awareness are the abilities to recognise your own emotions and how they play a part in work/learning environments(or just anywhere in general really) as well as others emotions.
            Motivation is wanting to do your work  because you enjoy it.</p></div>
            <div class="hifi"><p>How is it different from I.Q? Well iq is a point system that helps accurately determine the intelligence of someone, and eq is the capacity of one's emotional wellness and awareness. 
            Your emotions play a big part in your everyday life so why wouldn't they affect your work ethic.
