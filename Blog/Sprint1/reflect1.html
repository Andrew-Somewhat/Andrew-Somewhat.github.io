        <div class="para3"><p>I don’t have any hard outlooks on life or what comes after, but rather i try to focus on the here and now.
            My friends asked me if i believe in any sort of god, and I have to say that I don’t but I don’t outright deny the possibility that one or more gods exist. Seems contradictory right? Which makes it hard to put into words.What I believe in and not believe in are sentaments I can't quite put into words nor do I desire to. So I will just continue to hold them where no one can see or hear them. 
        </p>
        <p>One of my greatest weaknesses is once I lose interest or get bored of something it's near impossible to do it. 
            Weakness number 2 I don't take things very serious or i take things too seriuos there is no in between. 
            Weakness number 3 I get distracted very easily.
            WEAKNESS number 4 PROCRASTINATION.
            
            Strengths time.
            If I am interested in something I can usually get really good at it. 
            I’m easy going (This can be both a strength and a weakness)
            I'm good at listening to people talk (more than i am at talking)
            I have a vague approximation of knowledge.
