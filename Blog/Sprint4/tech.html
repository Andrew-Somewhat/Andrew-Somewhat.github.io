    <div class="lofi"><p>Well most of my problems had to do with writing at first but as javascript was 
        introduced i started to have problems with the code side of things. The biggest 
        problem for me was the magic symbols.</p><p> I mean these things ++ === >< ! &&.
        They all had different combinations and were used in completely different ways. 
        When I say that they confused me I don't mean like I saw them and I couldn't read 
        them as part of the code. I knew what they meant and what they did endavidgly but 
        put them together and being used in a loop.</p> <p>It took me way too long to figure out
         how to use them, I still don't have the greatest grasp of how to use them but after 
         using them first hand and researching them I have a much better understanding of 
         the symbols.</p><p>It felt so odd to not understand something so basic, and I learnt that
          certain things mean different things under different context.i.e this => is an
           arrow >= this means greater than or equal to.</p><p>I am not elegant so ye.</p>
