            Neuroplasticity is the measurement of the brain's capacity to improve.</p>
        <p>Spoilers its seemingly endless.The benefits of neuroplasticity are that it shows that your brain can improve even after its fully developed.</p> 
        <p>And I think it's pretty obvious as to how that  would affect your studies, 
        but in case it isn't it (since I didn't give a full explanation) if you keep practicing something you'll get better at it.I’m sure that you've heard similar sayings.

        <div class="header1"><h2>Growth Mindset!</h2></div>
        <div class="img7"><img src="../../styles/images/neu.jpg" alt="get" width="800px" height="400px"></div>
        <div class="lofi"><p>Growth mindset is the belief that you still have room to grow and reach new heights in terms of ye mind.</p><p> And simply believing you can grow, or at least being open to the idea that you can 
            improve and overcome a difficult task greatly helps learning capacity and rate.
            How will I integrate this info into my journey of improvement? I’ll not look down on myself as much and go forward with the thought of when i finish the course and not if I finish.
